    <h1>Why am I taking this course?</h1>
    <p>
        I believe the future of software and applications will ultimately all be in the cloud as web apps.  As connections get faster and faster, there won't need to be strong personal computers with lots of RAM or a big graphics card.  There will be server farms running high demand applications, all written in current or future programming languages, but ultimately fed to users using HTML, CSS, and other front and backend languages.
    </p>

        I want to know how it all works, and I want to be able to create content and make changes, instead of being someone that just sits idly by, letting someone else take care of it.
