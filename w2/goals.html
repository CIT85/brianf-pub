    <h1>Why am I taking this course?</h1>
    <p>
        After being in the job market for quite a few years straight out of high school, I decided to go back to school and get at least an Associate's Degree in Web Development, and may go on to a Bachelor's if I have the time.
    </p>

    <p>While I have a brief, self-taught background in mobile application development using Swift and Java, I've found that the web still offers plenty of challenges.  The web is universal to just about any device, so web applications are probably the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to know how it all works, and I want to be able to create content and make changes, instead of being someone that just sits idly by, letting someone else take care of it.
