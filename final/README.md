### How Sophisticated Can ChatGPT's output code be based on how detailed the prompts are?

I asked ChatGPT the following:  **How sophisticated can your code output be, depending on the proper prompts?**

Here is the output it gave me:

The sophistication of the code generated by ChatGPT depends on various factors, including the quality and specificity of the prompts, the complexity of the task, and the context provided. With well-crafted and detailed prompts, you can often get more sophisticated and precise code output.

Here are some tips to enhance the sophistication of the code generated:

1. Be Specific in Your Prompt:
Provide detailed information about what you want the code to accomplish. Include specific requirements, constraints, or examples that guide the model in generating the desired code.

2. Break Down the Problem:
If the task is complex, consider breaking it down into smaller steps. You can ask the model to solve individual components of the problem and then combine the solutions.

3. Specify Programming Language and Frameworks:
Clearly mention the programming language and any specific frameworks or libraries you want the code to use. This helps in generating code that aligns with your technology stack.

4. Use Follow-up Prompts:
If the initial response is not exactly what you need, you can use follow-up prompts to provide clarifications or guide the model towards the desired output.

5. Experiment and Iterate:
Feel free to experiment with different prompts and iterations. Adjusting and refining your prompts based on the model's responses can often lead to improved results.

While ChatGPT is a powerful language model, it's important to note that it might not always produce flawless or production-ready code. It's a tool to assist and provide ideas, but careful review and testing of the generated code are essential.

Remember that the model's knowledge is limited to what it has seen during training, and it may not be aware of developments or changes in technology beyond its last training cut-off in January 2022. Additionally, security and best practices should always be considered when using generated code in a real-world context.

## My Notes:
I think it will be an interesting challenge to see if I can ask ChatGPT to create some weird things in HTML/CSS, showing the exact prompt text and the output it produced based on that specific prompt.  The idea will be to show multiple examples with the prompts getting progressively more sophisticated to see how well ChatGPT can keep up.

## Notes for Project 3 - Switching to Flexbox

I think Flexbox has some cool abilities, but for my current layout I think the standard blocks and inline blocks just seemed to work better together.  It seems like I'm trying too much to force my content into a layout that doesn't necessarily benefit from the Flexbox layout.

## More notes on Project part 3 - Media Queries

I've picked a few sizes and made the background change color like Dave did, to show where each shifting point is.  In some cases I modified the font sizes or changed how the responsiveness works based on how it rendered in DevTools as I shifted between sizes.
