            <h3>What is ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, and it's based on
                the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture,
                specifically GPT-3.5. It is designed to generate human-like text
                based on the input it receives. The model has been trained on a
                diverse range of internet text up until my last knowledge update in
                January 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                GPT-3.5, like its predecessors, is a powerful and versatile model
                that can perform various natural language processing tasks, such as
                answering questions, generating creative writing, translating
                languages, and more. It has been used in applications like chatbots,
                content generation, code generation, and language understanding
                tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that ChatGPT doesn't have consciousness,
                self-awareness, or true understanding. It generates responses based
                on patterns it learned during training on a massive dataset. Users
                should be aware of its limitations, and the responses should be
                interpreted with caution, as they may not always be accurate or
                appropriate.

            <h3>The Ethical Dilemma</h3>
            <p>
                I posed a simple question to ChatGPT. Is it ethical to use ChatGPT to
                write code?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The ethics of using ChatGPT or any other AI model to write code depend
                    on how it is used and the context in which it is applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understanding and Learning: If you're using ChatGPT to understand
                    how to write code or to learn new programming concepts, it can be a
                    valuable educational tool.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Assistance: Using ChatGPT to get assistance with coding challenges
                    or to generate code snippets can be ethical, as long as you
                    understand and review the code it produces. It's crucial to have a
                    good understanding of what the code is doing and to verify its
                    correctness.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Plagiarism: It's important to avoid using AI-generated code in a way
                    that constitutes plagiarism or violates academic or professional
                    integrity policies. Always give credit where it's due, and make sure
                    you understand and can explain the code you're using.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Critical Thinking: Relying solely on AI to write code without
                    understanding the underlying logic or purpose can hinder your
                    development as a programmer. It's essential to engage in critical
                    thinking and actively participate in the coding process.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Security and Quality: Be cautious about using AI-generated code in
                    security-critical applications or projects where code quality is
                    paramount. Always review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets
                    your requirements.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In summary, using ChatGPT to assist in coding can be ethical if
                    approached with a responsible mindset. It should be seen as a tool
                    for learning and productivity, but not as a substitute for
                    understanding the code you are working with. Always review, test,
                    and validate the code generated by AI to ensure it meets your
                    specific needs and standards.

            <h3>In Summary</h3>
            <p>
                ChatGPT performed well in some areas and fell down in others. One
                obvious issue came to light recently, when trying to validate the
                pages. There were instances where ChatGPT's code didn't validate
                because it was deprecated code. This means it was using coding methods
                that were still currently allowed, but no longer best practice, and
                ultimately will be totally unsupported. Since ChatGPT lags behind a
                few years, it's writing code where the available data says it's
                currently supported... but it's not at the current time. So keep that
                in mind should you ever decide to use ChatGPT to help with code
                questions. It may not be using the most up-to-date methods!
