    <h1>These are my goals!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                After being in the job market for quite a few years straight out of high school, I decided to go back to
                school and get an Associate's Degree in Web Development.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The web is universal to just about any device, so web applications are probably the future.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I want to know how it all works, and I want to be able to create content and make changes, instead
                of being someone that just sits idly by, letting someone else take care of it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Once I've accomplished all of that, I'll then focus my attention on taking over the world!
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
